If you like to support Peter's work, then please purchase the EWS book from your [[https://books2read.com/b/4NpgQ9][favourite e-book retailer]] or a [[https://payhip.com/b/alhIJ][DRM-free download from PayHip]]. The Org source code of the complete book is available in the =documents= folder, so you can also 'roll your own'.
 
Feel free to raise an issue if you have any suggestions on how to enhance the configuration or like to see additional packages useful to authors. Alternatively, join the GitHub discussion forum.

* EWS Workflow
The EWS configuration and associated website and book follow a basic workflow for authoring documents. The chapters of the book follow this basic workflow and introduce new Emacs concepts as needed.

* Install EWS
The EWS configuration follows the following principles:

- Stay as close as humanly bearable to vanilla GNU Emacs
- Leverage functionality in Emacs 29
- Standard keyboard shortcuts
- No configuration for writing code (~prog-mode~)
- Centred around Org mode

The =init.el= file contains the configuration and the =ews.el= file defines a series of convenience functions.

To install the EWS configuration, download the =init.el= and =ews.el= files from the GitHub repository and save them in the configuration folder. The location of the configuration folder depends on your operating system and Emacs version. Type =C-h v user-emacs-directory= to identify its location in the popup help buffer.

Copy both files from the EWS repository to this directory. EWS will activate after you evaluate the ~restart-emacs~ function or the next time you start the program.

Experienced Emacs users, can try the EWS configuration by cloning this repository and start Emacs with =emacs --init-directory <folder-path>=. That way you can try EWS without clobbering your existing configuration.

The EWS configuration works independent of the operating system you use. However, the system does rely on a set of supporting applications that Emacs uses to undertake specialised tasks.

* Supporting Applications
Emacs is not only a text editor but also an interface to other software. EWS interface with software that Emacs uses for various tasks.

When EWS starts, a message will appear in the =*Messages*= buffer listing the missing software. Some of the listed packages are alternatives for each other, for example (=convert= or =gm=). The core functionality of Emacs will work fine without this software, but some specialised tasks require assistance from this software.
